        <h2>Stratification of tumor cells using deep learning</h2>
        <img src="projectpic1.jpg" alt="projectpic">
        <p> The project is based on identification of tumor cells using deep learning.
            </br>
            Different types of algorithms were applied and CNN model gave good results.
            </br>
            Worked with dataset having images with tumors like meningioma, glioma, and pituitary tumors
            </br>
            We used multilayered CNN model with transfer learning based VGG16 model.

        <h2>Detection of fake images using  machine learning</h2>
        <<img src="project2.jpg" alt="projectpic">
        <p> This project deals with detection of fake images
            </br>
            Different types of pictures were collected and the model used for predicting classified
            </br>
            whether the image is fake or real.
